    Test class for testing the functionality of the CommlibFactory.

    Methods
    -------
    setUp()
        Initializes the test environment before each test case.
    test_get()
        Tests the basic functionality of the CommlibFactory.
    tearDown()
        Cleans up the test environment after each test case.
